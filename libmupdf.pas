    Pixmaps represent a set of pixels for a 2 dimensional region of a

    always alpha. The data is in premultiplied alpha when rendering, but
    non-premultiplied for colorspace conversions and rescaling.

    An fz_colorspace object represents an abstract colorspace. While
    this should be treated as a black box by callers of the library at

 {
      Fitz COOKIE - simple communication channel between app/library.
      Provide two-way communication between application and library.
      Intended for multi-threaded applications where one thread is
      rendering pages and another thread wants read progress
      feedback or abort a job that takes a long time to finish. The
      communication is unsynchronized without locking.

      abort: The appliation should set this field to 0 before
      calling fz_run_page to render a page. At any point when the
      page is being rendered the application my set this field to 1
      which will cause the rendering to finish soon. This field is
      checked periodically when the page is rendered, but exactly
      when is not known, therefore there is no upper bound on
      exactly when the the rendering will abort. If the application
      did not provide a set of locks to fz_new_context, it must also
      await the completion of fz_run_page before issuing another
      call to fz_run_page. Note that once the application has set
      this field to 1 after it called fz_run_page it may not change
      the value again.

      progress: Communicates rendering progress back to the
      application and is read only. Increments as a page is being
      rendered. The value starts out at 0 and is limited to less
      than or equal to progress_max, unless progress_max is -1.

      progress_max: Communicates the known upper bound of rendering
      back to the application and is read only. The maximum value
      that the progress field may take. If there is no known upper
      bound on how long the rendering may take this value is -1 and
      progress is not limited. Note that the value of progress_max
      may change from -1 to a positive value once an upper bound is
      known, so take this into consideration when comparing the
      value of progress to that of progress_max.

      errors: count of errors during current rendering.

// Fitz CONTEXT

{   Specifies the maximum size in bytes of the resource store in

      The global state contains an exception stack, resource store,
      etc. Most functions in MuPDF take a context argument to be
      able to reference the global state. See fz_free_context for
      freeing an allocated context.

      alloc: Supply a custom memory allocator through a set of
      function pointers. Set to NULL for the standard library
      allocator. The context will keep the allocator pointer, so the
      data it points to must not be modified or freed during the lifetime
      of the context.

      locks: Supply a set of locks and functions to lock/unlock
      them, intended for multi-threaded applications. Set to NULL
      when using MuPDF in a cfloat-threaded applications. The
      context will keep the locks pointer, so the data it points to
      must not be modified or freed during the lifetime of the
      context.

      max_store: Maximum size in bytes of the resource store, before
      it will start evicting cached resources such as fonts and
      images. FZ_STORE_UNLIMITED can be used if a hard limit is not
      desired. Use FZ_STORE_DEFAULT to get a reasonable size.
